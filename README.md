- **Typography:**
  [Annie use your teleskope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Annie+Use+Your+Telescope) was selected for text content. It's a cute font that is easy to read by children and yet has a certain lightness. 
  [Barlow Semi Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed) is an easy-to-read, clear font that is simple to grasp, so it was used for the instructions. 
  The font [Are you serious](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Are+You+Serious) was selected for the logo. It represents the fun and joy the game should bring. 
  > Are You Serious doesn't take itself seriously at all. This is a fun playful font with a very joyful spirit. _(Google Fonts)_

## Features

### Existing Features

All the pages were created with a mobile first approach and are made responsive. To ensure that the layout of the pages remains consistent even on very large screens, the text body has been given a maximum width and a margin on both sides.

## Testing

1. **Validator Testing**

- **[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)**

  - result for index.html<br>
    ![HTML results index with errors]()
   

I also checked all pages in the validator via text-input, and likewise no errors were detected in this way. All I got was an information to avoid trailing slashes in void elements.

- **[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**
   - result for styles.css <br>
     ![CSS result]()
     The warning is due to import of the Google fonts.

2. **Lighthouse Test** <br>
   To measure the website against performance, accessibility, SEO and best practice I used [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=de).<br>
   
- result for index.html:<br>
  
  

3. **Manual testing** <br>

To ensure the pages are responsive, I used the Google Chrome developer tools.
